<h3>July 10, 2017</h3>
<p> Today we talked a lot about robots and what characteristics define robots. We defined robots as anything that is programmed to 
     do a certain task. My idea of robots changed because now I know that they are more than just a Roomba (self-vacuuming vacuum). 
     I am excited about the future of robots because they can really change the way humans do things and they have great potential to
     help disabled people in many ways. We researched about Kavita Krishnaswamy and all her work in robots to help disabled people move,
     which is super cool! However, it does make me a little scared and nervous because robots can become smarter than 
     humans (but we have a while until then!). </p>
     
<p> We also worked in groups on circuits today. I think it was great because most of my group members were familiar with what we were 
    doing an really helped me out. Next time, we could move closer together and work because the big table was a bit awkward. We were far 
    from each other so it was difficult for us to all work at the same time. </p>
